## 📍 Overview

This SwiftUI project is a UI clone of the Twitter iOS app. It is crafted to closely resemble the interface and user experience of the official Twitter app (2019. design), providing an immersive environment for developers to learn and experiment with SwiftUI. The project uses local JSON data to simulate the dynamic content found in a typical Twitter feed, focusing on the UI aspects of the app.

---

## 📦 Features

· SwiftUI-Based UI: The entire user interface is built using SwiftUI, offering a native and responsive experience across all iOS devices.
· Home Feed: The core of the app, the home feed, displays a list of tweets in a scrollable timeline, mimicking the familiar Twitter experience.
· Tweet Composition: Users can simulate the creation of new tweets, showcasing the use of state management and forms in SwiftUI.
· Tweet Interaction: Each tweet supports interaction patterns typical to Twitter, such as replies, retweets, and favorites, which are reflected in real-time within the UI.
· Profile Simulation: User profiles are represented with avatars and nicknames, giving a realistic touch to the tweet list.
· Local Data: The app uses a local tweets.json file to load and decode tweet data, simulating network calls and data persistence.
· MVVM Architecture: Utilizes the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern to separate the UI from the business logic, making the code more manageable and testable.
· Custom Views: Includes custom views like TweetRow, which are reusable components that represent individual tweets within the feed.
· Navigation: Implements NavigationStack to handle user navigation, prepared for future expansion to detailed tweet views or user profiles.
· Dynamic UI: Adapts to different device orientations and screen sizes, ensuring a consistent UI/UX.

| [HomeContentViewModel.swift](https://github.com/marislakss/twitter-demo-swiftui/blob/main/TwitterDemo/HomeContentViewModel.swift) | The `HomeContentViewModel` class is responsible for managing the tweets data and handling actions related to tweets. It includes two main functions:1. `loadTweets()`: Loads tweets from a JSON file and decodes them into an array of `Tweet` objects. If the tweets are already loaded, it prints a message. If the JSON file or data cannot be located or loaded, it prints corresponding error messages.2. `createTweet(title:description:)`: Creates a new `Tweet` object with random ID, username, nickname, creation time, and other attributes. The created tweet is then appended to the `tweets` array.This code represents the model part of the SwiftUI-based Twitter demo application, providing the logic for loading and creating tweets. |
| [tweets.json](https://github.com/marislakss/twitter-demo-swiftui/blob/main/TwitterDemo/tweets.json)                               | The code represents a directory structure and a JSON file called "tweets.json". The "tweets.json" file contains an array of JSON objects, each representing a tweet with various properties like the tweet ID, username, nickname, creation date, message, image, number of replies, retweets, favorites, and avatar image. The directory structure contains multiple Swift files and assets related to a Twitter demo SwiftUI application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [TweetRow.swift](https://github.com/marislakss/twitter-demo-swiftui/blob/main/TwitterDemo/TweetRow.swift)                         | The `TweetRow.swift` file defines a SwiftUI view called `TweetRow` that displays a single row of a tweet in a Twitter-like interface. It displays the user's profile image, nickname, username, tweet message, and optional message image. The row also includes buttons for actions like replying, retweeting, liking, and sharing the tweet. The state variables track whether the buttons are selected or not. The `TweetRow` view is previewed using sample data in `TweetRow_Previews`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [TwitterDemoApp.swift](https://github.com/marislakss/twitter-demo-swiftui/blob/main/TwitterDemo/TwitterDemoApp.swift)             | The code represents the structure of a Twitter Demo SwiftUI app. It contains various files and directories, including assets, view models, views, and JSON data. The main functionality of the code lies in the `TwitterDemoApp.swift` file, which defines the `TwitterDemoApp` struct conforming to the `App` protocol. The `body` property of this struct represents the main scene of the app, displaying the `ContentView` view when the app is launched.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [HomeContentView.swift](https://github.com/marislakss/twitter-demo-swiftui/blob/main/TwitterDemo/HomeContentView.swift)           | The code is for the "HomeContentView" SwiftUI view in the TwitterDemo app. It displays a list of tweets fetched from the "tweets.json" file using the "HomeContentViewModel" class. Each tweet is rendered using the "TweetRow" view. The view also has a button to trigger the "NewTweetView" modal sheet, allowing users to create new tweets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [HomeView.swift](https://github.com/marislakss/twitter-demo-swiftui/blob/main/TwitterDemo/HomeView.swift)                         | The code represents the HomeView in a TwitterDemo SwiftUI app. It displays the main content of the app, HomeContentView, along with a navigation toolbar. The toolbar includes a button with an oval image on the left, a "Home" text in the center, and a button with an iconSparkle image on the right. Tapping the iconSparkle button presents a NewTweetView.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [Tweet.swift](https://github.com/marislakss/twitter-demo-swiftui/blob/main/TwitterDemo/Tweet.swift)                               | The code above represents a file named "Tweet.swift" in a project called "TwitterDemo" written in Swift. It defines a struct named "Tweet" that conforms to the Decodable protocol. The struct has several properties including the ID, username, nickname, creation date, message, message image (optional), number of replies, number of retweets, number of favorites, and the URL of the avatar image.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [NewTweet.swift](https://github.com/marislakss/twitter-demo-swiftui/blob/main/TwitterDemo/NewTweet.swift)                         | The code is a part of a TwitterDemo SwiftUI application and specifically focuses on creating a new tweet. The NewTweetView struct is responsible for displaying the new tweet interface, which includes a cancel button, a tweet button, an image, and a text editor for entering the tweet text. The tweet text is stored in a @State variable and is updated as the user types. When the tweet button is pressed, the tweet text is printed and the view is dismissed. The code also includes a preview for testing the NewTweetView component.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
